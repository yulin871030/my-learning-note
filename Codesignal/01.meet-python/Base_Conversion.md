Your university professor decided to have a little fun and asked the class to implement a function that, given a number n and a base x, converts the number from base x to base 16. To make things more interesting, he announced that the first student to write the solution will have to answer fewer question than the rest of the class during the final exam.

Laughing devilishly, you asked if it was okay to use a language of your choice, and the unsuspecting professor answered "yes". It's settled then: Python is your language of choice!

Now you're bound to win. Implement a function that, given an integer number n and a base x, converts n from base x to base 16.

Example

```
For n = "1302" and x = 5, the output should be
baseConvertion(n, x) = "ca".

Here's why:
13025 = 20210 = ca16.
```

- Input/Output
    - [time limit] 4000ms (py3)
    - [input] string n

- A valid non-negative integer in base x. The string is guaranteed to consist of digits and lowercase English letters.

- Guaranteed constraints:
    - 1 < n.length ≤ 10.

- [input] integer x
    - The base of n.

- Guaranteed constraints:
    - 2 ≤ x ≤ 36.

- [output] string

The value of n in base 16. The string should contain only digits and lowercase English letters 'a' - 'f'.

**Answer**

```python
def baseConversion(n, x):
    return hex(int(n,x))[2:]
```

先將n的x進位利用int()轉換為十進位,再利用hex() function將十進位轉換為十六進位,由於十六進位會產生字首「0x」,所以要再加入[2:]從第2位開始輸出
