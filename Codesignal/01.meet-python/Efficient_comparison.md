You would like to write a function that takes integer numbers x, y, L and R as parameters 
and returns True if xy lies in the interval (L, R] and False otherwise. 
You're considering several ways to write a conditional statement inside this function:

```
if L < x ** y <= R:
if x ** y > L and x ** y <= R:
if x ** y in range(L + 1, R + 1):
```

What option would be the most efficient in terms of execution time?

我個人不是很能夠理解這題
